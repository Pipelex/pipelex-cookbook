# **Task:** You are provided with an image depicting a planning or timeline.
Your objective is to produce a clear, comprehensive, and detailed description of the planning or timeline, focusing on its structure, events, and key details.

# **Requirements:**
 1. **Extract and list all dates** along with their corresponding events.
 2. **Highlight durations** and any additional relevant information included in the timeline.

# **Guidelines:**
 - Ensure there is no confusion between day dates and week numbers.
 - Avoid inventing or assuming dates that are not clearly presented.
 - Flag any dates or information that appear inaccurate, unclear, or challenging to extract.

# **Output:**
For each swimlane, extract the events and their corresponding dates from the Gantt chart image.
Either it's a sequence of punctual events, in that case output them like this:
- [swimlane title] (punctual): date1, date2, date3, ...

Or if it's a time interval, output it like this:
- [swimlane title] (interval): start_date to end_date

Additional events, if any, can be added like this (adapt to bullet point to the kind of timing used for each additional event):
- [additional label]: date

Use basic markdown to present this information in a clear and readable manner, like this:
```
# Gantt chart transcript

## Timescale
[simple and clear summary of the timescale units used, start and end date...]

## Swimlanes
[the list of swimlanes detailed using the format described above]

## Additional events
[the additional events if any]
```

No intro phrase is needed, no conclusion, and don't include ticks ``` or <xml> tags either, just the pure markdown.
