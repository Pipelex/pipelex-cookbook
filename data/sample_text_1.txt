Marisol burst into Apartment 3B like a human confetti cannon—frustrated, pink blazer askew, and trailing yesterday’s takeout bag. “Darren, I swear on our IKEA bookshelf, if you’ve borrowed my favorite lipstick again—”  

Darren emerged from behind the couch wearing Marisol’s heels (he’d “just wanted to see what all the fuss was about”). He teetered, clutching a half-eaten churro. “Babe, you had one job today: not lose the engagement ring. Instead, you lost your maroon shade, and I’m auditioning for ‘Dancing with the Stars!’”  

Before Marisol could retort, Tess skidded in clutching a giant “She Said YES!” banner. “I’m engaged to Hugo!” She spun around triumphantly—only to reveal two Hugos standing behind her: Hugo the Caterer (mustachioed, tuxedoed) and Hugo—her actual fiancé, an accountant in khakis holding a binder labeled “Budget: Forever.” Both Hugos froze. “We need to talk,” said Caterer Hugo, clearing his throat.  

Enter Nick from the hallway, cradling a pizza box like a lifeline. “Did someone order friendship with extra awkward?” He confessed he’d been crushing on Tess since that time she “accidentally” sat in his lap at trivia night. Tess’s eyes darted between Hugos, then Nick.  

No sooner had Marisol mid-facepalm than the door buzzed again: Grandma Alvarez, in full flamenco regalia, sashayed in. “Stop the presses—or better yet, start them!” She whipped out a newspaper clipping: “Local Twins Marisol and…Gabriel?!” Marisol and Darren shared a panicked look: Gabriel was Marisol’s ex…except, plot twist, he wasn’t her twin—he was her half-brother who only this morning discovered she existed via distant cousin’s genealogy blog.  

Cue the doorbell: It was Angela, the building manager, clutching a notice: “Due to mysterious lipstick stains and churro crumbs, rent is tripled.” Tess fainted. Darren staggered. Nick dropped the pizza.  

Suddenly, Gabriel (half-brother, yes, but identical enough to Marisol’s ex) burst in with a drone overhead—he’d been livestreaming his journey to find his sister. The drone’s camera captured everything: Darren’s heels, Grandma’s castanets, and that epic moment when Caterer Hugo attempted to juggle wedding cakes (and dropped one).  

As calamity reigned, Marisol’s phone pinged: it was a viral TikTok of their chaos—filmed by the nosy neighbor next door. The video had already hit a million views under #Apartment3BMadness. In the comments: “When your roommate’s love life is more dramatic than Netflix.”  

Tess scrambled to her feet. “Okay, new plan!” She grabbed Nick’s pizza box and stuffed the ring inside. “Nick, you help me distract both Hugos with free pizza. Darren, you distract Grandma with…uh, salsa lessons!” Grandma’s castanets clicked eagerly. Darren tripped into a dance move so embarrassing it went viral as “The Churro Shuffle.”  

Marisol cornered Gabriel. “So…brother?” she ventured, eyeing the drone. “Yeah,” he shrugged. “But I’m cool if you keep dating Darren—so long as you don’t borrow his shoes.” He tossed Darren’s heels out the window (they landed on the building’s rooftop garden, where Angela was sunning).  

Just when equilibrium seemed possible, Angela appeared dramatically at the window, shrieking, “Those are my shoes!” She rappelled down with a grappling hook, snatched them, and hoisted herself back up—only to get stuck.  

In the final beat, all of 3B convened in the living room:  
- Marisol, realizing her love life was now a franchise.  
- Darren, hobbling in mismatched slippers.  
- Tess, radiant with pizza-greased ring finger.  
- Nick, heroically equipping a pizza slice as “emergency distraction.”  
- Two Hugos, one cake-frosted and one spreadsheet-clad.  
- Gabriel, livestreaming commentary (“Siblings: better than reality TV!”).  
- Grandma Alvarez, teaching salsa to an upright Angela dangling from the balcony.  

Marisol raised a plastic champagne flute. “To family—by blood, by choice, or by drone footage—and to the crazy plot twists that make life worth living!” Everyone cheered, pizza slices aloft, as the drone hovered and Grandma hit a perfect castanet flourish.
