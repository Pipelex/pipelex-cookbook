Lena storms into the living room holding a frying pan like it’s evidence in a crime. “Who left tofu sizzling on low for two hours? The apartment smells like burnt gym socks and betrayal!” she yells. Jay, half-buried under a weighted blanket on the couch, raises a finger, “In my defense, I was trying to slow-cook it... spiritually.” Maya, sipping her coffee, deadpans, “If enlightenment smells like this, I’m converting.”

Maya sighs and drops her phone dramatically. “He brought his mom to the first date and said she had to approve of my ‘aura.’” Jay chuckles, “Did she at least like your aura?” Maya glares, “She said I was ‘chaotically beige.’ What does that even mean?” Lena smirks, “Probably that you’re exciting in a deeply confusing way.”

The doorbell rings—pizza delivery. Jay sprints to the door like it’s a game show buzzer, but returns looking puzzled. “They sent us a pineapple-and-anchovy combo with a card that says, ‘To the weirdest trio I’ve ever met.’” Maya reads the card and grins, “Ah. Looks like my date’s mom sent us dinner.” Lena shrugs, “Guess beige tastes better than we thought.”
