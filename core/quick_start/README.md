# Quick Start Examples to get started with Pipelex

This folder contains small scripts that demonstrate the basics of running Pipelex.
Run them from the repository root after installing the dependencies and setting up
your `.env` file.

- `check.py` verifies that the library loads correctly.
- `hello_world.py` runs a minimal pipeline that returns a greeting.
- `summarize.py` loads the text in `assets/sample_text_1.txt` and produces a structured summary.

Example:

```bash
python core/quick_start/hello_world.py
```
